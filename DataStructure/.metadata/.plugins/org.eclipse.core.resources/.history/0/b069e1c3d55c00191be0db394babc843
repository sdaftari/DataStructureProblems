Find and print the uncommon characters of the two given strings S1 and S2. Here uncommon character means that either the character is present in one string or it is present in other 
string but not in both. The strings contains only lowercase characters and can contain duplicates.
Time Complexity: O(m + n), where m and n are the sizes of the two strings respectively.
