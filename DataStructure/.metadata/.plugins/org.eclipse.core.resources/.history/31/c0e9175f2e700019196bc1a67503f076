//A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
//For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
//1, 3, 5, 7, 9
//7, 7, 7, 7
//3, -1, -5, -9
A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.


Example:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.

        {
            // keep increasing the splice
            if(A[i] - A[i-1] == A[i-1] - A[i-2]) 
                len++;

                len = 2;
