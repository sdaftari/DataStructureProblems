There are some glasses with equal capacity as 1 litre. The glasses are kept as follows:
                   1
                 2   3
              4    5    6
            7    8    9   10
You can put water to only top glass. If you put more than 1 litre water to 1st glass, water overflows and fills equally in both 2nd and 3rd glasses. Glass 5 will get water from both 2nd glass and 3rd glass and so on.
If you have X litre of water and you put that water in top glass, how much water will be contained by jth glass in ith row?

Example. If you will put 2 litre on top.
1st – 1 litre
2nd – 1/2 litre
3rd – 1/2 litre
