//Given an array of 0 and 1. In how many iterations it is possible that the whole array can be filled with 1's, if in a single iteration immediate neighbors of 1's can be filled.
//Examples:
//Input:
//2
//4
//1 0 1 0
//17
//0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
//
//Output:
//1
//2
//
//Explanation:
//Test Case 1: Both the 0s has 1 as their immediate neighbour. So, we only need one iteration to fill the array with 1.
//Time: O(n)

	//	Let count_zero be the count of zeros in the block.
	//	Number of iterations are always equal to : count_zero/2, if (count_zero is even) or (cont_zero+1)/2    if(count_zero is odd).
	//	Case 2 : Either single 1 at the end or in 
	//	         the starting. For example 0 0 0 0 1 and 
	//	         1 0 0 0 0
	//	In this case the number of iterations required will 
	//	always be equal to number of zeros.
	//	Case 3 : There are no 1s (Array has only 0s)
	//	In this case array can't be filled with all 1's. 
	//	So print -1.
