Find Two Missing Numbers | Set 2 (XOR based solution)
Given an array of n unique integers where each element in the array is in range [1, n]. The array has all distinct elements and size of array is (n-2). Hence Two numbers from the range are missing from this array. Find the two missing numbers.

Examples:

Input  : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 6}, n = 6
Output : 2 4

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 4}, n = 5
Output : 3 5

Input : arr[] = {1, 2}, n = 4
Output : 3 4
