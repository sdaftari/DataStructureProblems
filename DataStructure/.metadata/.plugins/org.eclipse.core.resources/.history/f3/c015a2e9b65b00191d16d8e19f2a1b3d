//Example 1:
//Input: [5,3,4,5]
//Output: true
//Explanation: 
//Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
//Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
//If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.
//If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.
//This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.
