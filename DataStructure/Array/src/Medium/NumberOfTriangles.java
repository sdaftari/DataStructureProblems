//Given an unsorted array of positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of triangles. 
//For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of any two values (or sides) must be greater than the third value (or third side).
//For example, if the input array is {4, 6, 3, 7}, the output should be 3. There are three triangles possible {3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 7} and {3, 6, 7}. 
//Note that {3, 4, 7} is not a possible triangle.
//
//Time Complexity: O(n^2).
