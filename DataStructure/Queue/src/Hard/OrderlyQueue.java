//A string S of lowercase letters is given.  Then, we may make any number of moves.
//In each move, we choose one of the first K letters (starting from the left), remove it, and place it at the end of the string.
//Return the lexicographically smallest string we could have after any number of moves.
//Example 1:
//Input: S = "cba", K = 1
//Output: "acb"
//Explanation: 
//In the first move, we move the 1st character ("c") to the end, obtaining the string "bac".
//In the second move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the final result "acb".
//Example 2:
//
//Input: S = "baaca", K = 3
//Output: "aaabc"
//Explanation: 
//In the first move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the string "aacab".
//In the second move, we move the 3rd character ("c") to the end, obtaining the final result "aaabc".
